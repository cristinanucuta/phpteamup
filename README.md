# PHP Team Up 

## Purpose 
To help inexperienced php developers improve their learning processes by introducing team mates into mentor-apprentice relationships.
Team mates would often answer most of apprentice's questions, offloading the mentor, who could then use gained time to help others.

## Problem
Lately, we see initiatives aiming at helping developers learn by pairing them up with experienced developers, so called mentors.
That's great, but when a mentor helps his so called apprentice, he's only hepling one person at a time. 
What if we could bring this to the next level?

## Solution
To create a web application, that allows people to team up for a given goal, for ex. "Learn PHPUnit". Then, a best fitting mentor 
is assigned to the team, and gives it a task. Team completes a task, and on the way it learns PHPUnit. Mentor reviews the task and 
gives feedback. If the team has problems on the way (and it probably does), team mates try to help each other. Most of 
the times, it's enough. If not, and everyone is stuck, only then they contact the mentor. That way, his efficiency is maximized, 
and more people can benefit from his knowledge.
